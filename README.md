Wayfer is a simple app for desktop-to-mobile file transfers.

# Installation

For now, you'll have to build the package yourself.
Clone the repo and run yarn build.

# Usage

1.  Drag a file to the Wayfer window (you can also double click the window)
2.  Scan the QR code

QRs can be scanned using the built-in camera app (iOS) or using a QR scanner app (Android)
